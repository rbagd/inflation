This small project uses mostly `shiny` and `gpplot2` packages for `R` to visualize Belgian inflation data as a modest web application. Data is imported (and so heavily dependent on its format) from an Excel/CSV file provided by Belgian SPF Economie.

[Project hosting](http://spark.rstudio.com/rytis/inflation) is kindly provided by RStudio.

**UPDATE**: On February 11, 2014 the format of the Excel file changed with an update to the index. Source files have not been updated yet as I hope to eliminate the need for Excel file all together and sync data directly from the SPF data server. I am waiting their response.
