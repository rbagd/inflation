This small project uses mostly `shiny` and `lattice` packages for `R` to visualize Belgian inflation data as a modest web application. Previous version used `ggplot2` for plotting but `lattice` seems to be more responsive and thus more suitable for such web deployment. Data is imported (and so heavily dependent on its format) from an Excel/CSV file provided by Belgian SPF Economie.
