This small project uses mostly `shiny` and `gpplot2` packages for `R` to visualize Belgian inflation data as a modest web application. Data is imported (and so heavily dependent on its format) from an Excel/CSV file provided by Belgian SPF Economie.

[Project hosting](http://spark.rstudio.com/rytis/inflation) is kindly provided by RStudio.
